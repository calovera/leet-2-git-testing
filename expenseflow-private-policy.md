## Overview

ExpenseFlow ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our manual expense tracking application.

## Information We Collect

**We collect zero personal information.**

ExpenseFlow does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All expense entries, categories, and settings remain entirely on your device.

All data you enter into ExpenseFlow is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

ExpenseFlow does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or tracking tools.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any user data to third parties because we do not collect or have access to any user data.

## Security

Because all data remains on your device, the security of your information depends on your device's security settings. We recommend using device passcodes, biometric authentication, and keeping your operating system up to date.

## Children's Privacy

ExpenseFlow does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The app is designed for general audiences and does not require any personal information to function.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
